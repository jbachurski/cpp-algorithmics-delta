# cpp-algorithmics-delta

My collection of algorithms and solutions for algorithmic tasks collected over the years. 

- `AlgorithmicsSet` - a lot of solutions to problems, solved by contests and then problems. Mostly Polish and hard to find online, some contests were closed. The older ones especially may sometimes not be finished, but usually should be marked with a different suffix/comment if they were broken.
- `Common` - contains KTL which was my attempt at a templated library for algorithms & data structures in competitive programming.
- `Ideas` - this has some *very old* problem ideas and materials. It began the movement towards Esoterica (computer science club).

I used C++ for almost all of these, with some exceptions for Python - especially in testing and *particular* problems.

Relatedly, also check out https://kubin.w.staszic.waw.pl/ under "Esoterica". Unfortunately, most of those materials are in Polish, but let me know if you would like to see them in English and I just might edit & translate them!

**Please do not use these during competitions and on other occassions other than private work and always ask for permission first.**
